"Red sky in morning, sailor’s warning. Red sky at night, sailor’s delight."

A red sky can serve as both a predictive warning and a symbol of secure passage. 

Red Sky Cyber strives to do both:
1. Assisting you in identifying gaps in your cloud and cybersecurity knowledge 
and
2. Guiding you towards the answers through shared resources 

In doing so, I aim help you achieve a more fulfilling and abundant cyber security career.

Hey! I'm Mike Dame, and I have 5+ years of experience in Offensive Security, working for Fortune 50 enterprises and more recently, consulting across multiple industries. I hold the OSCP, CRTO, PNPT, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, AWS Certified Security Specialty certifications to name a few.

My goal is to facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity resources, especially those in the realm of cloud security, cloud penetration testing, and cloud red teaming. This way, you can learn, grow, and develop your skills and confidence to become the very best professionals you can be.

If there are any tools, training, labs, certifications, or resources that you think I should add, please feel free to share them!

Cyber security is a community, and communities thrive through the sharing of resources.
